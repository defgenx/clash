## Features

- **Session management** — list, attach, detach, create, stash, and delete Claude Code sessions
- **Inline terminal** — attach to sessions with a full terminal passthrough, status bar showing session name / project / branch
- **Real-time status** — instant status detection via hooks, daemon PTY screen analysis, and JSONL parsing (three-layer system)
- **Animated status icons** — active sessions show animated spinners and pulsing icons for visual feedback
- **Section-based layout** — sessions are grouped into Active (working), Done (idle/stashed), Fail (errored), and External (wild claude processes started outside clash, kept at the bottom so they don't interleave with clash-managed rows) with stable alphabetical ordering; press `A` to cycle section filter
- **In-process daemon** — embedded PTY daemon manages sessions without a separate process
- **Git worktree support** — spawn sessions in isolated worktrees for parallel feature branches (`w` key); worktree column shows `⊟ project/worktree` for project context
- **Repo config discovery** — auto-detects MCP servers, custom commands, agent definitions, and setup scripts from the project directory
- **Teams & tasks** — create, configure, and delete teams (description, members with agent type and model); organize agents, manage tasks, send messages
- **Subagent tracking** — view subagent trees per session, expand/collapse in the sessions table
- **Open in IDE** — press `e` to open a session's project in your editor (auto-detects Cursor, VS Code, Zed, JetBrains, nvim, vim; configurable)
- **Keyboard-driven** — vim-style navigation, command mode (`:`), fuzzy filter (`/`), context help (`?`)
- **UI state persistence** — restores navigation, selection, filters, and expanded sessions on restart
- **Multi-instance** — run several clash apps (TUI and/or GUI) side by side; each owns its own sessions via a per-instance daemon socket
- **Guided tour** — first-launch walkthrough, replay anytime with `:tour`
- **Debug mode** — `clash --debug` enables verbose logging with a header indicator
- **Self-updating** — `:update` in the TUI or `clash update` from the CLI

## Installation

### Quick install (Linux / macOS)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/defgenx/clash/main/install.sh | bash
```

Custom install path:

```bash
CLASH_INSTALL_DIR=~/.local/bin curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/defgenx/clash/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Build from source

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/defgenx/clash.git
```

Or from a clone — installs **both** the TUI and the GUI
(override paths with `INSTALL_DIR=~/.local/bin` / `APP_DIR=~/Applications`):

```bash
make install            # or: make install-tui / make install-gui
```

The TUI installs as the `clash` binary in `INSTALL_DIR`. The GUI installs
as a regular desktop application, discoverable like any other app:

- **macOS** — `Clash.app` in `/Applications` (falls back to
  `~/Applications` when not writable): Spotlight, Launchpad, Dock. A
  `clash-gui` symlink lands in `INSTALL_DIR` for terminal launching.
- **Linux** — `clash-gui` binary plus an XDG `clash.desktop` launcher
  entry and icon (system-wide under `/usr/local/share` as root,
  per-user under `~/.local/share` otherwise).

### Requirements

- Rust 1.75+ (for building from source)
- Claude Code CLI (`claude`)

## Usage

```bash
clash                              # Start (reads from ~/.claude)
clash --data-dir ~/.claude         # Custom data directory
clash --claude-bin /path/to/claude # Custom CLI path
clash --debug                      # Enable debug logging
clash update                       # Update to the latest release
```

On first launch, clash installs lifecycle hooks into `~/.claude/settings.local.json` for instant status detection and shows a guided tour. Replay it anytime with `:tour`.

### Session Status

clash detects session status through three layers (in priority order):

1. **Hooks** — Claude Code lifecycle events (`PermissionRequest`, `Stop`, `SessionStart`, etc.) write instant status updates
2. **Daemon PTY** — screen content analysis pattern-matches the terminal for prompts, approval dialogs, and thinking indicators
3. **JSONL baseline** — conversation log heuristics (last entry type, stop reasons, timing)

| Icon | Status | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| `◆◇` | Prompting | Claude needs tool approval — blinking diamond |
| `◉` | Waiting | Awaiting your next prompt |
| `◌◎◉` | Thinking | Reasoning / generating — pulsing circle |
| `⠋⠙⠹…` | Running | Executing tools — braille spinner |
| `○◔◑◕●` | Starting | Session just spawned — filling circle |
| `✗` | Errored | Session crashed shortly after starting |
| `○` | Stashed | Exited or inactive |

### Session Source Prefixes

Each row in the sessions list may carry a single-character prefix indicating where its underlying Claude process lives:

| Prefix | Source | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| (none) | Daemon | clash spawned and manages the PTY — attach with `o` or Enter |
| `⊞ `  | External | clash spawned the process in another pane/tab/window via `o`/`O` |
| `🌿 ` | Wild | A `claude` process started outside clash. Press `a` to take over: one confirm, then clash kills the outside process (SIGTERM, SIGKILL after 2s) and attaches to its conversation under the daemon (`--resume <id>`) |

The Wild detection runs in the background every ~2s. clash surfaces every wild claude PID **that started after this clash launched** under the EXTERNAL section — pre-existing claudes from before clash booted are intentionally hidden, the section is for things spawned during this session. Each wild process is **dynamically associated with a conversation**: exact evidence first (`--resume <id>` / `--session-id <id>` in argv, or — rarely — the `.jsonl` held open as an fd), otherwise the **most recently modified conversation in the process's working directory**. The association is re-evaluated on every scan, so it always tracks the latest conversation. Only a bare `claude` in a directory with no conversation on disk at all (typically the few seconds before a brand-new conversation's JSONL appears) shows as a PID-keyed row with takeover disabled. Press `d` to drop a wild row: clash signals the PID directly (SIGTERM, SIGKILL after 5s if still alive and still claude). The row also disappears on the next scan tick once the process exits, so closed/stopped claudes never linger. List the section in isolation with `:external`. The GUI behaves the same way: clicking a wild row (or its ⚡ button) confirms, takes over, and opens the terminal.

## Data

clash reads directly from Claude Code's filesystem:

```
~/.claude/
├── projects/{name}/
│   ├── sessions-index.json            # Session index with summaries
│   ├── {session-id}.jsonl             # Conversation log
│   └── {session-id}/subagents/        # Subagent transcripts
├── teams/{name}/config.json           # Team config + members
├── tasks/{team-name}/{id}.json        # Tasks
└── settings.local.json                # Hook registrations (written by clash)
```

clash also maintains its own state in `~/.claude/clash/`:

```
~/.claude/clash/
├── hooks/status-hook.sh               # Lifecycle hook script
├── status/{session-id}                # Instant status from hooks
├── names/{session-id}                 # Session display names
├── project-names/{encoded-cwd}        # Project-to-name mapping
├── sessions.json                      # Session registry
├── ui_state.json                      # Persisted UI state (nav, selection, filters)
└── trusted_repos.json                 # SHA256 trust store for repo setup scripts
```

Daemon sockets: `~/Library/Application Support/clash/daemon-<pid>.sock` (one
per running instance; `clash attach` auto-discovers the instance that owns a
session).

## Session Presets

Presets are reusable templates for session creation. When presets are available, pressing `n` shows a picker; otherwise the manual 3-step flow is used.

### Project presets (`.clash/presets.json`)

```json
{
  "presets": {
    "backend-fix": {
      "description": "Backend bugfix workflow",
      "directory": "./",
      "worktree": true,
      "setup": ["./.clash/setup-backend.sh"],
      "teardown": ["./.clash/teardown.sh"]
    },
    "frontend-feature": {
      "description": "New frontend feature",
      "directory": "./frontend",
      "worktree": false
    }
  }
}
```

### Global presets (`~/.config/clash/presets.json`)

Same format as project presets. Project presets override global presets with the same name.

### Superset compatibility

If `.superset/config.json` exists, it appears as a synthetic "superset" preset with the `setup` and `teardown` fields mapped directly.

### Preset fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `description` | string | Shown in the preset picker |
| `directory` | string | Working directory (relative or absolute) |
| `prompt` | string | Initial prompt for Claude |
| `worktree` | bool? | `true`/`false` = auto, omit = ask |
| `setup` | string[] | Scripts to run after session creation |
| `teardown` | string[] | Scripts to run before session drop |

Setup scripts receive `CLASH_ROOT_PATH` and `CLASH_SESSION_ID` env vars. Each script has a 30s timeout.

## Architecture

clash follows **The Elm Architecture** (TEA) with clean architecture layers:

```
User Input → Action → reducer() → (State', Effects) → execute_effects() → draw()
                        (pure)                          (infrastructure IO)
```

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Domain** | Entities, port traits — no dependencies |
| **Application** | State, actions, effects, pure reducer |
| **Adapters** | Input mapping, view rendering |
| **Infrastructure** | Event loop, filesystem, daemon, CLI, TUI widgets |

## Development

```bash
cargo test          # Run all tests
cargo clippy        # Lint
cargo fmt --check   # Check formatting
```

Releases are automatic — push with conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`) and CI handles the rest.

## GUI (experimental)

A cmux-style desktop client lives in `gui/` — a Tauri 2 app sharing the same
core as the TUI (session pipeline, in-process PTY daemon, protocol). Sidebar
with session sections and status rings; embedded xterm.js terminals attach to
the same sessions the TUI manages.

GUI features: fuzzy search (`/` or `⌘F`), inline rename (double-click),
new session via the sidebar's `＋ New session` button (`⌘T`) with preset
picker and git-worktree option — the directory prefills from the configured
default directory, falling back to the focused session's project, then home —
rename/details/stash/kill/take-over from a per-session `⋯` menu (also on
right-click of the row), unlimited split panes in a balanced grid (`⌘D`
splits, `⌘⇧D` closes the focused pane, zoom `⌘⇧↩` or double-click the
pane title, `⌘⌥←/→` cycles focus), teams browser (members with
live-activity dots and model chips, tasks, agent inboxes, create/delete
via the + button or right-click menu; in the details panel click the
description to edit it, `＋ Add member` to add an agent, and right-click
a member to change its model or remove it), `⌘K` clears the active
terminal,
middle-click detaches a tab, and quit-stash on close. Tabs and panes
follow one rule: the active tab is always the content of the focused
pane — clicking a tab fills the focused pane, focusing a pane activates
its tab, and closing a pane keeps its session reachable as a tab. A
labeled `TUI` badge-button in the sidebar header launches the clash TUI
alongside the GUI (split pane when started from a pane-capable terminal,
else a new terminal window) — gold when a TUI is running somewhere, grey
when not. The sidebar footer holds a SETTINGS section: default directory
for new sessions, terminal font size and font family (live-applied),
scrollback lines, cursor style (block/bar/underline) and blink,
copy-on-select, "⌥ sends Esc (Meta)" (off = Option always composes
characters — international layouts), whether terminal links open in the
embedded browser or the system browser, a desktop-notifications toggle,
and an `⟳ Update clash` self-update button — when the update lands, a
modal offers Restart / Cancel (restarting closes running sessions).
Settings persist in `gui-state.json`. The sidebar and details panel are
drag-resizable (widths persist).

Sessions carry the same status vocabulary as the TUI — animated
PROMPTING / THINKING / RUNNING / WAITING / STARTING / STASHED / ERRORED
labels in the sidebar and a colored status dot per tab. External claude
processes (started outside clash) are segregated in their own
`⚡ EXTERNAL` section at the bottom of the sidebar with distinct styling;
clicking one (or its ⚡ button) takes it over after a confirm — the
outside process is killed and its conversation (dynamically associated,
always the latest in that directory) opens attached under clash.
Right-click a tab for the context menu:
rename, close (detach), stash, kill, details.

The details panel (ⓘ) is a compact overview — live status, branch,
project, CWD, summary. Conversation, Subagents, and Diff open as full
tabs in the main area (closable like terminal tabs); the panel's TOOLS
row has Ports, Open-in-IDE, and Open-in-browser pickers — the latter
opens the diff on GitHub (the PR's files view, or a compare view of the
session branch against the default branch), the session's PR, or the
repository. (The local diff opens as an in-app tab, not in the browser.)

Embedded browser (cmux-style, `⌘⇧B`): a native webview panel docked on
the right with browser tabs (`+` to open, `×` per tab, `×` in the
toolbar closes the whole panel), URL bar, back/forward/reload, and
open-in-system-browser.
URLs printed in any terminal are clickable and open there; listening
ports open `localhost:<port>`; and when a session's output mentions a
GitHub pull request, a green `⇄ PR #n` chip appears on the session (and
in the tab's right-click menu) that opens the PR in-app. Note: the
browser is a native overlay — in-app dialogs can't draw over it.

Workspaces (cmux-style): each workspace owns its pane layout AND its
sessions — `⌘N` new, `⌘1-9` switch, `⌘⇧R` rename, `⌘⇧W` or the chip's
`×` to close, `⌘B` toggles the sidebar. The sidebar and the tab strip
are scoped to the active workspace: its sessions in status sections,
plus an UNASSIGNED group for sessions no workspace has claimed (opening
one claims it). Tabs owned by another workspace stay hidden until you
switch back; unassigned tabs are always visible.
Searching (`/`) is global across workspaces — results from other
workspaces carry a `⌘n` badge and open in their owning workspace.
Closing a workspace returns its sessions to the unassigned pool.
Right-click a workspace chip for its context menu: rename, close, and
mass-kill all of that workspace's sessions (one confirmation); the
UNASSIGNED header carries a `✕` button that mass-kills all unassigned
sessions the same way.
Layouts and session ownership are saved to disk (`gui-state.json` in the
clash app-support dir) and survive restarts (running sessions re-attach
automatically).

Notifications: desktop alerts when a session starts waiting for input or
errors (suppressed while the window is focused), unread badges in the
sidebar, plus in-band `OSC 9` / `OSC 777` terminal notification sequences —
`printf '\e]777;notify;Title;Body\a'` from inside any session raises an
alert, so agents and scripts can ping you.

```bash
cargo build --release           # builds BOTH binaries: clash and clash-gui
./target/release/clash-gui      # run — can run alongside the TUI
                                # (each instance owns its own sessions)
```

Release tarballs ship both binaries, and updating from either side
(`clash update`, `:update`, or the GUI's `⟳ Update clash` button)
installs/updates both. Existing installs are replaced through their
symlinks — on macOS the binary inside `Clash.app` is the one updated, the
bundle's `Info.plist` version is bumped, and the bundle is re-signed, so
Finder/Dock launches pick up the new version too.
On Linux, building requires the Tauri system deps (webkit2gtk):
`libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libgtk-3-dev librsvg2-dev libxdo-dev`.

The GUI is fully self-contained: no external daemon, no node build step
(frontend assets in `gui/dist/` are vendored and embedded in the binary).
