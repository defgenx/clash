## Features

- **Session management** — list, attach, detach, create, stash, and delete Claude Code sessions
- **Inline terminal** — attach to sessions with a full terminal passthrough, status bar showing session name / project / branch
- **Real-time status** — instant status detection via hooks, daemon PTY screen analysis, and JSONL parsing (three-layer system)
- **Animated status icons** — active sessions show animated spinners and pulsing icons for visual feedback
- **Section-based layout** — sessions are grouped into Active (working), Done (idle/stashed), and Fail (errored) sections with stable alphabetical ordering; press `A` to cycle section filter
- **In-process daemon** — embedded PTY daemon manages sessions without a separate process
- **Git worktree support** — spawn sessions in isolated worktrees for parallel feature branches (`w` key); worktree column shows `⊟ project/worktree` for project context
- **Repo config discovery** — auto-detects MCP servers, custom commands, agent definitions, and setup scripts from the project directory
- **Teams & tasks** — create, view, and delete teams; organize agents, manage tasks, send messages
- **Subagent tracking** — view subagent trees per session, expand/collapse in the sessions table
- **Open in IDE** — press `e` to open a session's project in your editor (auto-detects Cursor, VS Code, Zed, JetBrains, nvim, vim; configurable)
- **Keyboard-driven** — vim-style navigation, command mode (`:`), fuzzy filter (`/`), context help (`?`)
- **UI state persistence** — restores navigation, selection, filters, and expanded sessions on restart
- **Single-instance lock** — prevents multiple clash instances from running simultaneously
- **Guided tour** — first-launch walkthrough, replay anytime with `:tour`
- **Debug mode** — `clash --debug` enables verbose logging with a header indicator
- **Self-updating** — `:update` in the TUI or `clash update` from the CLI

## Installation

### Quick install (Linux / macOS)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/defgenx/clash/main/install.sh | bash
```

Custom install path:

```bash
CLASH_INSTALL_DIR=~/.local/bin curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/defgenx/clash/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Build from source

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/defgenx/clash.git
```

### Requirements

- Rust 1.75+ (for building from source)
- Claude Code CLI (`claude`)

## Usage

```bash
clash                              # Start (reads from ~/.claude)
clash --data-dir ~/.claude         # Custom data directory
clash --claude-bin /path/to/claude # Custom CLI path
clash --debug                      # Enable debug logging
clash update                       # Update to the latest release
```

On first launch, clash installs lifecycle hooks into `~/.claude/settings.local.json` for instant status detection and shows a guided tour. Replay it anytime with `:tour`.

### Session Status

clash detects session status through three layers (in priority order):

1. **Hooks** — Claude Code lifecycle events (`PermissionRequest`, `Stop`, `SessionStart`, etc.) write instant status updates
2. **Daemon PTY** — screen content analysis pattern-matches the terminal for prompts, approval dialogs, and thinking indicators
3. **JSONL baseline** — conversation log heuristics (last entry type, stop reasons, timing)

| Icon | Status | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| `◆◇` | Prompting | Claude needs tool approval — blinking diamond |
| `◉` | Waiting | Awaiting your next prompt |
| `◌◎◉` | Thinking | Reasoning / generating — pulsing circle |
| `⠋⠙⠹…` | Running | Executing tools — braille spinner |
| `○◔◑◕●` | Starting | Session just spawned — filling circle |
| `✗` | Errored | Session crashed shortly after starting |
| `○` | Stashed | Exited or inactive |

## Data

clash reads directly from Claude Code's filesystem:

```
~/.claude/
├── projects/{name}/
│   ├── sessions-index.json            # Session index with summaries
│   ├── {session-id}.jsonl             # Conversation log
│   └── {session-id}/subagents/        # Subagent transcripts
├── teams/{name}/config.json           # Team config + members
├── tasks/{team-name}/{id}.json        # Tasks
└── settings.local.json                # Hook registrations (written by clash)
```

clash also maintains its own state in `~/.claude/clash/`:

```
~/.claude/clash/
├── hooks/status-hook.sh               # Lifecycle hook script
├── status/{session-id}                # Instant status from hooks
├── names/{session-id}                 # Session display names
├── project-names/{encoded-cwd}        # Project-to-name mapping
├── sessions.json                      # Session registry
├── ui_state.json                      # Persisted UI state (nav, selection, filters)
└── trusted_repos.json                 # SHA256 trust store for repo setup scripts
```

Single-instance lock file: `~/.local/share/clash/clash.lock`

## Session Presets

Presets are reusable templates for session creation. When presets are available, pressing `n` shows a picker; otherwise the manual 3-step flow is used.

### Project presets (`.clash/presets.json`)

```json
{
  "presets": {
    "backend-fix": {
      "description": "Backend bugfix workflow",
      "directory": "./",
      "worktree": true,
      "setup": ["./.clash/setup-backend.sh"],
      "teardown": ["./.clash/teardown.sh"]
    },
    "frontend-feature": {
      "description": "New frontend feature",
      "directory": "./frontend",
      "worktree": false
    }
  }
}
```

### Global presets (`~/.config/clash/presets.json`)

Same format as project presets. Project presets override global presets with the same name.

### Superset compatibility

If `.superset/config.json` exists, it appears as a synthetic "superset" preset with the `setup` and `teardown` fields mapped directly.

### Preset fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `description` | string | Shown in the preset picker |
| `directory` | string | Working directory (relative or absolute) |
| `prompt` | string | Initial prompt for Claude |
| `worktree` | bool? | `true`/`false` = auto, omit = ask |
| `setup` | string[] | Scripts to run after session creation |
| `teardown` | string[] | Scripts to run before session drop |

Setup scripts receive `CLASH_ROOT_PATH` and `CLASH_SESSION_ID` env vars. Each script has a 30s timeout.

## Architecture

clash follows **The Elm Architecture** (TEA) with clean architecture layers:

```
User Input → Action → reducer() → (State', Effects) → execute_effects() → draw()
                        (pure)                          (infrastructure IO)
```

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Domain** | Entities, port traits — no dependencies |
| **Application** | State, actions, effects, pure reducer |
| **Adapters** | Input mapping, view rendering |
| **Infrastructure** | Event loop, filesystem, daemon, CLI, TUI widgets |

## Development

```bash
cargo test          # Run all tests
cargo clippy        # Lint
cargo fmt --check   # Check formatting
```

Releases are automatic — push with conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`) and CI handles the rest.
